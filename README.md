## Regex Components

### **Anchors**

The anchors `^` and `$` are used to specify the beginning and end of the string, respectively. 
### **Quantifiers**

In this snippet: `[a-fA-F0-9]{6}` the {6} specifies that the preceding character class should be repeated six times. In this one: `[a-fA-F0-9]{3}` it means the character class should be repeated three times. Normally, curly braces are in the following format: {min, max}, but when the comma and max are excluded, it searches for the exact number of repetitions of min.

### **Grouping Constructs**

This part of the regex: `([a-fA-F0-9]{6}|[a-fA-F0-9]{3})` is grouped together using parentheses. This is called a capture group and could be referenced using `\1` later in the same regex to search for the exact same pattern again.

### **Bracket Expressions**

`[a-fA-F0-9]` is a bracket expression. The brackets tell the regex engine to treat everything inside of them as one criterion.

### **Character Classes**

`[a-fA-F0-9]` is a character class inside a bracket expression. This shows the regex engine to search for *a single character* that meets any of these criteria: lowercase letters from a to f, uppercase letters from A to F, or digits from 0 to 9. 

### **The OR Operator**

`[a-fA-F0-9]{6}|[a-fA-F0-9]{3}` uses the OR operator in the form of `|`. Since RGB hex values can be written in three-digit form sometimes (i.e., the shorthand for 00FF00 is 0F0), the three-digit alternative is useful, even though it could potentially return three-letter words with letters from A to F. 

### **Flags**

This regex does not use any flags.

### **Character Escapes**

This regex does not use any character escapes.
